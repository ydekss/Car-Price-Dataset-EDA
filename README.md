# Car-Price-Dataset-EDA
In this project I have taken the most famous Car Price Dataset and tried to do an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to and visualize them.

## Car Price Dataset
The data has following features and variables:
1.  Symboling: Insurance risk rating of the car from -3 to 3, with negative values indicating lower risk and positive values indicating higher risk.
    
2.  CarName: Name of the car, including the make and model.
    
3.  fueltype: Type of fuel used by the car, either diesel or gas.
    
4.  aspiration: Type of aspiration used by the car, either standard or turbo.
    
5.  doornumber: Number of doors on the car, either two or four.
    
6.  carbody: Body type of the car, including sedan, hatchback, wagon, hardtop, and convertible.
    
7.  drivewheel: Type of drivetrain used by the car, including front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, and four-wheel drive.
    
8.  enginelocation: Location of the car engine, either front or rear.
    
9.  wheelbase: Distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels of the car.
    
10.  carlength: Length of the car in inches.
    
11.  carwidth: Width of the car in inches.
    
12.  carheight: Height of the car in inches.
    
13.  curbweight: Weight of the car without passengers or cargo.
    
14.  enginetype: Type of engine used by the car, including dohc, ohc, ohcf, ohcv, and rotor.
    
15.  cylindernumber: Number of cylinders in the car engine.
    
16.  enginesize: Size of the car engine in cubic centimeters.
    
17.  fuelsystem: Type of fuel system used by the car, including mpfi, 2bbl, 4bbl, idi, and spfi.
    
18.  boreratio: Ratio of the diameter of the car engine cylinder bore to its stroke.
    
19.  stroke: Distance traveled by the piston in the engine cylinder.
    
20.  compressionratio: Ratio of the volume of gas in the engine cylinder at its largest and smallest capacities.
    
21.  horsepower: Power of the car engine in horsepower.
    
22.  peakrpm: Maximum engine speed in revolutions per minute.
    
23.  citympg: Miles per gallon (MPG) of the car in city driving conditions.
    
24.  highwaympg: Miles per gallon (MPG) of the car in highway driving conditions.
    
25.  price: Price of the car in US dollars.
## These are some of the insights
![What's an Insight? (And Who Decides?) - Storylytics](https://storylytics.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/define-insight.png)
-  The distribution of car prices is highly right-skewed, indicating that there are a relatively small number of very expensive cars in the dataset.
    
-  The most common make of car in the dataset is Toyota, followed by Nissan and Mazda.
- The most expensive fuel type in the dataset is diesel, followed by gas.
-  Cars with rear engine location tend to be more expensive than those with front engine location.
    
-  Cars with higher engine sizes tend to have higher prices, with a strong positive correlation between engine size and car price.
    
-  Cars with more cylinders tend to have higher prices, with a strong positive correlation between number of cylinders and car price.
    
- Cars with higher horsepower tend to have higher prices, with a moderate positive correlation between horsepower and car price.
    
- Cars with higher fuel efficiency tend to have lower prices, with a weak negative correlation between fuel efficiency and car price.
    
- Cars with automatic transmissions tend to be more expensive than cars with manual transmissions.
    
-  The most common body type in the dataset is sedan, followed by SUV and coupe.
    
- The car prices vary widely across different car models and years, with some models having much higher prices than others.
- The most common fuel system in the dataset is mpfi (multi-point fuel injection), followed by 2bbl (two-barrel carburetor) and idi (indirect injection diesel).

# The End
These were all the insights that i came up with, but there are numerous and plenty more insights that you can find by exploring the workbook, feel free to look at the `ipnyb` file to explore more.
